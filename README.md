# Image-recognition-by-Deep-Learning-using-MATLAB-softwares
Using Deep Learning for recognizing an image using MATLAB Software.
It uses a pre-trained network AlexNet, which is used to recognize or predict an image with high accuracy rate.
Deeplearning using the High-Level Heavy Programming language like MATLAB can give more accurate result. This is an simple MATLAB program and using AlexNet pre-trained network for image classification using Deep Learning.

### OVERVIEW

This project is mainly used for image classification using a pre-trained network called AlexNet. This can be used for any of the image classifications. The accuracy is above 90%. This can be used for classification of images in a system within low time, and with high accuracy. The execution speed of the this is very faster without any delays. The main software used for this project is MATLAB.

### METHODOLOGY / APPROACH

In this image classifier using Deep Learning with MATLAB Software, we are using the pre-trained called AlexNet. The Operating System(OS) used is Windows 7 and the processor used is intel CORE i3.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED

Hardware used is Intel Core i3 with Windows 7 as Operating System(OS) and the software used is MATLAB.
