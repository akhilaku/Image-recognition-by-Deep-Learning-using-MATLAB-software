# Image-recognition-by-Deep-Learning-using-MATLAB-softwares
Using Deep Learning for recognizing an image using MATLAB Software.
It uses a pre-trained network AlexNet, which is used to recognize or predict an image with high accuracy rate.
Deeplearning using the High-Level Heavy Programming language like MATLAB can give more accurate result. This is an simple MATLAB program and using AlexNet pre-trained network for image classification using Deep Learning.
